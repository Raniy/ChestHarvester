ChestHarvester - turns chests into stationary farming equipment


Commands:
/chestharvester (ch) reload	reload configuration file (OP only)


Features:

chests can collect drops within a 1-block radius on the faces or from the top
clicking on a chest will farm the surrounding area, or in the direction the player is looking, if enabled
supports double-chests!
to minimize server strain, scans every 5 seconds & only allows farming every 2
(this can be changed with "AutoCollectScanInterval" and "ManualHarvestWaitInterval" in the config)
can be set to use a hoe to till new farmland
can harvest sugarcane & cactus, not just farmland :)

Permissions: 
ChestHarvester.harvest		for a user to be able to click on a chest for it to harvest 
					(can be disabled)


TODO:
iConomy support?
Autoharvest, so chests run automatically?
"special block" must be on to operate?
run chests on redstone?
make player manually set a chest for it to collect items?
